### Usage

#### Step 1: Get Your Weatherstack API Key

1. Visit Weatherstack and sign up for a free account.
2. Obtain your API Key from the API keys page.

#### Step 2: Set Up Your API Key

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open the Python script weather_fetcher.py.
3. Replace the placeholder "your_weatherstack_api_key_here" in the script with your actual Weatherstack API key.

#### Step 3: Run the Program

1. Navigate to the project folder where weather_fetcher.py is saved.
2. Run the script:

#### Error Handling

- If the script cannot fetch data due to network issues or invalid city names, it will display an error message.
- Ensure you have entered a valid city name and your API key is correct.

#### Future Improvements
- Support for multiple cities at once.
- Error handling for invalid API keys or bad responses.
- Extend the script to fetch a weather forecast for the upcoming days.
